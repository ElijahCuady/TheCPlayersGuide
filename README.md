# The C# Player's Guide (5th Edition) by RB Whitaker

This is a repository for saving my own solutions for the challenges given in the book.

While it may simply sound like an excuse for writing bad code, I will not spending that much time creating 
and optimizing all solutions, especially the "beginner" challenges. I will still write clean code and adhere to
basic and proper coding principles, but I will not be taking into account <b>every</b> single edge case for every single 
challenge. My main goal is to get more familiar and comfortable writing in C#, while learning the nuances and tricks behind it.
That necessitates a lot of experimenting, as well as trial and error. For anyone who sees this ReadMe, I hope this
repo alone doesn't determine how you see me as a developer, but rather prove the fact that I am eager to learn and improve
my skills whenever given the opportunity.

<b>TLDR:</b> Don't bully me for my caveman solutions
